What this is:
 
We're looking for an experienced front-end developer for a long-term contracting position (6+ months). The ideal candidate is a JavaScript expert and comfortable with Backbone.
 
What we need you to do:
 
Implement what you see here. Blue arrows indicate context transitions (see the next step in a workflow, invoke the workflow, end the workflow, etc.), red arrows indicate possible errors, and yellow arrows point to interesting "gotcha"-type things that you'll want to pay attention to.
 
Notes:
 
1. Clicking "Skip Edits" or "Import and Edit" in "Paste in some data" context ALWAYS triggers a parse of what's currently in the text-area.
2. Editing a fruit name and then cicking "Back" will not affect a change in the original text displayed in the "Paste in some data" context
3. The "Back" button will do different things depending on the last context the user was viewing.
4. If the "Edit Data" context is displayed after clicking "Back" from the "Results" page, previous edits will remain (the context holds state even after progressing further through the workflow).
 
Libraries at your disposal:
 
JSON2
jQuery
qTip2
Backbone
Underscore
Marionette (bonus points!)
